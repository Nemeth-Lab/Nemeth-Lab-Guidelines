# Lab Culture Expectations

## 1. Integrity
We aim to foster an environment of highly scientific minds in the laboratory. With this commitment comes the responsibility of maintaining a strong sense of integrity. Mistakes happen; however, mistakes should not result from carelessness or rushed work. If you make a mistake, it is your responsibility to address it, take ownership, and employ strategies to correct it.

## 2. Being Present
The age of social media has introduced more distractions than ever before. In the lab, it is expected that we remain present and focused on the work we are doing. While some tasks may feel monotonous, tedious, or overwhelming, diverting focus during critical moments can lead to careless mistakes. Being present—actively listening, learning, and doing—will help you succeed in this lab.

## 3. Collaboration
We foster a collaborative environment where multidisciplinary approaches come together to tackle complex questions. Our team includes individuals from diverse scientific backgrounds, encouraging a wide range of ideas and methodologies to address research challenges.

## 4. Respect
Respect your fellow lab members. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, their need for quiet when required, and their desire for support and a listening ear when needed. Respect their culture, religion, beliefs, and sexual orientation.

## 5. Support
Everyone in the lab should feel supported, and everyone is expected to support others. While not everyone in the lab will be close friends, supporting one another is crucial for the lab to function at its highest level. Failing to take the high road and support your lab mates makes you part of the problem.

# Day-to-Day Expectations

## 1. Attendance and Communication
You are expected to arrive on time for the hours you set at the beginning of the semester. Upon arrival, check in with your assigned lab personnel before beginning any planned experiments.

If you plan to miss your scheduled lab time, you must notify your assigned lab personnel **at least 24 hours in advance**.

### Additional Notes
- Individuals on payroll are expected to work primarily on weekdays unless otherwise specified.
- Postdoctoral fellows, lab managers, and technicians typically have more structured and strict hours than students (undergraduate and graduate).

## 2. Work Hours
You are not expected to work on weekends or holidays, nor are you expected to stay late at night. You **are** expected to complete your assigned work responsibly and on time.

## 3. Illness
If you are sick, take care of yourself and stay home. It is your responsibility to reschedule any meetings, experiments, or obligations in a timely manner.

## 4. Dress Code
The dress code is casual (and you are welcome to dress up if you like!), but not overly casual. When interacting with participants or presenting your work, avoid pajamas or sweatpants. Jeans are completely acceptable.

## 5. Lab Cleanliness
Keep the lab tidy. Return equipment to its proper location after use and keep common areas clean and uncluttered.
