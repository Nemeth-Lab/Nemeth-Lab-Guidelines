# Guideline for Authorship

## Why do we need these rules:

1. To encourage collaboration and to make sure everyone involved in a project receives appropriate credit.
2. To ensure timely publication of our findings without wasting precious resources.
3. To avoid potential conflict and misunderstanding.

## Rules for First Authors:

### A. Leader and the organizer of the project

1. You need to understand the hypothesis and significance of the project.
2. You need to keep up with literature and be the world expert on this topic.
3. You need to plan the research in detail and design most of the experiments (with my help).
4. You need to perform the experiments and generate the most data presented in the paper.
5. You need to troubleshoot, seek help from others, and initiate alternative plans when necessary.
6. You need to make sure the project is moving forward fast enough to publish your work in a good journal.

### B. You need to write and revise both the manuscript and the figures until the work is submitted

1. **Postdoctoral fellows** need to make all the figures and write the entire manuscript, including Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Figure legends. PI's need to revise and confirm all manuscripts prior to publication.
2. **Graduate students and Postbacs** need to make all the figures, write the first draft of the paper, and revise the paper with the help from the PI.

### C. You need to submit the paper before you leave the lab

1. If you finish the first submission of the paper, you have secured your status as the first author of the paper. If the paper needs to be substantially revised for re-submission, other authors may become equal first author for the paper, depending how much others have to add to this paper.
2. If you leave the project without submitting the paper, you may lose your first author status only if significant parts of the paper are required to be added to finish. The first author of the paper will be determined by me based on the contribution of authors and completeness of the project.

## Rules for co-authors:

You need to be intellectually involved in designing the specific experiments or a critical component of the physical labor of the project.

1. You need to physically generate data for figure(s) in the paper.
2. Consultants can be included, if their suggestions are intellectually vital to the project and make substantial edits.
3. Be able to contribute to the work and have an understanding of/can interpret the results properly.
