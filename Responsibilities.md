# Personnel Expectations/Responsibilities

## Principal Investigator

• Support you (scientifically, emotionally, financially) 
• Challenge you scientifically and cognitively. 
• Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference
posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
• Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to
discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
• Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about
surviving and thriving in academia
• Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field,
promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you
attend conferences as often as finances permit
• Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or
a job outside of academia
• Care for your emotional and physical well-being and prioritize that above all else.


## Post-Docs
• Develop and execute your own independent line of research while furthering the lab’s research goals and helping others in the lab on their projects.
• Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to. 
• Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
•Apply for grants (e.g., NRSA, K99)
•Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready.
•Challenge PIs, Post-docs, and Grad Students when your opinion is different. Do so in a courteous and respectful manner. 

## Graduate Students
• Work on your own research project (developed with the PI) along with helping others in the lab on their projects. 
• Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
• Apply for grants (e.g., NRSA or NSF grants). It’s a valuable experience, and best to get it
early.
• Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry,
science writing, something else), and talk to the PI about it to make sure you’re getting
the training you need for that career.
• Make sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for your exams and thesis) -- and
make sure PI and all lab members are aware of them!
• Prioritize time for research. Coursework and TAing are important, but ultimately your
research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career. 
• Realize there are times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine.

## Undergraduate Students

### Non-Thesis 
• Assist lab members with data collection and analysis. 
• Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your lab mentor. You should be coming in every week and scheduling enough time to get your work done. Our expectations are that you will come in a minimum of 15hrs a week. These hours will change during finals week as we know it gets stressful to balance both. 
• If you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your
schedule permits. 
• Going above and beyond includes presenting at one of these lab meetings and submitting a write-up of your research by the end of the semester. 

### Thesis-track: 
•We expect all the above responsibilities in the non-thesis track along with the additional points: 
•We expect your thesis to be the prime focus, however this does not mean all your time will be dedicated to your thesis. You will be responsible for your own time management to get both your thesis research and other priorities in the lab to be conducted simultaneously. 
• Your thesis is a difficult task that is time consuming and tedious. Give yourself ample time to conduct, analyze, depict, and write your thesis. An example timeline will be provided in its own section. 
• Due to the rigorous nature of conducting a thesis, you will be considered a senior lab member by the end of your undergraduate career. With this comes many additional responsibilities that newer students will not have. You may be asked to help other graduate students, post-docs and undergrads for help on their project. You will be expected to help as many others as possible with their projects.
• While your thesis/project comes first, it will most likely not be occurring all be at once. In the interim, you will be asked to help with other projects to push them along further. Please be amenable to working on multiple projects.
