# Undergraduate Thesis Guidelines

Please see https://www.fau.edu/honors/documents/thesis-guidelines.pdf for detailed descriptions of your thesis.

Because honors projects necessarily rely on lab resources, they need to fall within the overall scope of lab research. I have a list of possible honors projects to choose from which fit within our ongoing research which we can use as a starting point for our discussions.

It is your responsibility to check what the requirements are in your program and make sure to have those deadlines met. To have proper oversight, please send your mentor calendar invites well in advance to set up meetings, editing sessions, etc to make sure you meet the deadlines.

**Do not start your thesis in the last week of your final semester.**

## Deadlines for Thesis Projects

| Milestone | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|
| Register for thesis credits | Prior to Fall/Spring of Senior year |
| Topic Picked | Spring Junior year (2-3 months of lab work) |
| To-do list created | 1 month after Topic Picked |
| Experimental procedures/literature search | Immediately after creating To-Do list |
| Materials ordered (if needed) | 3-6 weeks after creating To-Do list |
| Data collection | Summer or Fall of senior year |
| Progress Report (oral presentation) | Before end of each semester |
| Data collection | Spring semester Senior year |
| Final Report (oral presentation) | 1 semester before graduation |
| Written Draft of thesis | 1 semester before graduation |
| Send to mentor for editing | 3 months before graduation |
| Send to PI for editing | 2 months before graduation |
| Final Draft of thesis Due to PI | 1 month before graduation (March or Nov) |

## Grading Criteria

When picking a topic, your mentor and you will create a To-do list. This list will serve as a progress report which will be considered modifiable. Most research inquiries will generate new questions and those will be added to the To-do list.

- If no progress (not including technical difficulties or negative data) is made on any of the topics, a grade of **"Unacceptable"** will be given.
- Additionally, failing to meet deadlines for Honor's theses will result in an **"Unacceptable"** on your thesis project.
- If the initial questions are answered but no follow up questions are answered, an **"Honor's Thesis"** will be awarded.
- If the student shows that they have mastery of the topic and can create new avenues from the current data and conducts further experiments to test those new questions, the student will receive **"Honors with Distinction"**.

## Rubric for Thesis Distinction

| Criteria | Unacceptable | Honors' Thesis | Honor's Thesis with Distinction |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Completion** | Did not meet or rushed major deadlines. | Completed major deadlines and completed a substantial portion of the project. | Completed all major deadlines and the entire planned project. |
| **Research & Analysis** | Demonstrated poor understanding of the topic, flawed methodology, and inaccurate analysis. | Demonstrated solid understanding of the topic, sound methodology, and accurate analysis. | Demonstrated exceptional understanding of the topic, innovative and well-implemented methodology, and insightful analysis that significantly contributes to the field. |
| **Writing & Presentation** | Poorly organized, unclear, and grammatically incorrect writing. Unprofessional and unclear presentation. | Well-organized, clear, and grammatically correct writing. Professional and effective presentation that communicates the research findings. | Exceptionally well-organized, clear, and engaging writing. Polished and captivating presentation. |
| **Originality & Contribution** | Lacks originality and does not contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge. | Demonstrates some originality and contributes modestly to the existing body of knowledge. | Demonstrates significant originality and makes a substantial contribution to the existing body of knowledge, potentially leading to new research directions or applications. |
| **Effort & Engagement** | Limited effort and engagement throughout the project. | Consistent effort and engagement throughout the project. | Exceptional effort and engagement throughout the project, demonstrating initiative, leadership, and a passion for research. |
