# Introduction
Welcome to lab! This manual is designed to provide you with essential guidelines and protocols for conducting yourself in our laboratory. Your safety, the safety of others, and the integrity of our research are our top priorities.

Our primary focus revolves around exploring Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling within the Central Nervous System (CNS). Specifically, our research centers on understanding the implications of IL-1 signaling in astrocytic and choroid plexus neurobiology related to homeostatic neural processes like cognition, memory, and affect along with neurological diseases such as anxiety, depression, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.

# Background information

## Interleukin-1 (IL-1) Signaling
Interleukin-1, a key cytokine involved in the immune system's response, has garnered substantial attention due to its multifaceted roles beyond immune modulation. Within the CNS, IL-1 signaling plays pivotal roles in mediating diverse physiological and pathological processes, extending far beyond its classical immune-related functions. We have identified multiple immune and non-immune functions of IL-1 and we plan to further identify how IL-1 signals in health and disease. 

# Objectives and Impact
Through our studies, we aim to shed light on the nuanced mechanisms of IL-1 signaling within the various unique cell types of the CNS --- emphasizing its roles in astrocye and choroid plexus neurobiology. By unraveling these pathways, we strive to contribute to the broader understanding of CNS function, neuroinflammatory processes, and potential implications for neurological disorders.

Our lab's pursuit is not just academic; it holds significant implications for potential therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating IL-1 signaling pathways to address neurological conditions and improve overall brain health.
