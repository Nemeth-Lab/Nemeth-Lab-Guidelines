# Laboratory Conduct

## Cleanliness and Organization:

1. Keep your workspace clean and organized. If you arrive to a messy space, please note it, clean it, and report to the lab manager/Senior Research fellow about the issue.
2. Clean spills immediately and dispose of waste in designated containers.
3. 	Respect for equipment and resources.
4. 	Use lab equipment only for its intended purpose.
5. 	Shared equipment and resources responsibly and communicate with others about usage schedules.

## Following Protocols:
1.	Adhere to experimental protocols and procedures provided by supervisors.
2.	Document experiments accurately and comprehensively.
3.	Log all deviations from the protocol thoroughly.

## Communication:

1.	Communicate effectively with team members and supervisors about experiments, results, and any issues or concerns.


## Respect:

1. Fostering a respectful and collaborative environment for all.
2. Promoting a culture of diversity and inclusivity within the lab
3. Addressing unconscious bias and promoting fair treatment of all lab members.

# Ethical Guidelines
## Data Integrity:

1. Maintain the integrity of data and research findings.
2. Avoid plagiarism or falsification of data.
    * I send ALL final version of abstracts and manuscripts through plagiarism checkers prior to submission. If caught you may be terminated from the lab. 
  3.	Respect for experimental participants:
  * Follow ethical guidelines when working with animal subjects. 
  * Obtain necessary approvals before conducting experiments involving animal subjects.
4. 	Artificial intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, CoPilot, Claude, etc. should ONLY be used for generalized ideas, helping with structure and internal documentation, and learning how to code. It should not be used for abstract submissions, thesis writing, or publications without proper citation of the source.
    * For instance: parts of this manual were generated with ChatGPT and Claude. Since this is internal documentation, it is OK.
    *  Please see [FAU Library Plagiarism and AI](https://libguides.fau.edu/plagiarism) 

## Additional Considerations

## Personal Hygiene:

1.	Wash hands before and after handling materials.
2.	Refrain from eating, drinking, or applying cosmetics in the lab.
3.	If you work with animals, no perfumes, colognes, or other strong smells are permitted.

## Continuous Learning:
(1)	Participate in training sessions and workshops offered by the lab and institute.
(2)	Stay updated with advancements and safety protocols in your area of research.
(3)	Attend and present data, methods, or interesting papers, related to our field, at lab meetings. 
(4)	Attend seminars put on by the university.
