# General Policies

Being present in the lab offers valuable opportunities for learning, collaboration, and resource access. However, we also recognize the need for flexible work schedules in academia. This policy aims to balance these needs by encouraging regular lab attendance while allowing for individual work styles and commitments.

We encourage everyone to treat lab work as a real job, aiming for an average of 40 hours per week. Your primary goal should always be completing your assigned work. If you find yourself more productive working from home, occasional remote work is acceptable.

For graduate students, we understand that classes and TA duties may require your absence from the lab. However, when free from these obligations, we encourage regular lab attendance. To maximize interaction and collaboration, consider "peak hours" (11am-4pm) for lab presence.

Lab managers and research assistants are expected to maintain a more regular schedule, being present in the lab 5 days per week, excluding valid absences. They should aim for 8 hours per day, starting around 9/10am and ending around 5/6pm.

While I may occasionally send emails or Teams messages outside of normal working hours, please ignore these messages until your next work session. Urgent weekend needs will always be discussed in advance. However, if my off-hours communication causes you stress, please don't hesitate to discuss it with me.

Remember, this policy is designed to promote a balance between flexibility and responsibility. Open communication is key to managing expectations and ensuring a positive and productive work environment for all.
