# Guideline for Research Presentations

## Why we do need these rules:

1. To avoid presenting data before they have been confirmed by further experiments. Science is based on trust and reputation. If the data is not confirmed, we cannot present it in public.
2. To protect our collaborators and ourselves from competition. We are work in a competitive field. In order to publish our work in timely fashion and stay competitive, we need to gather enough data (close to the point of publishing) before publicize our discoveries.
3. To make sure everyone involved in the project receives appropriate credit.

## Rules:

1. The data that have been presented in our lab meeting by our lab members are confidential! If you plan to, or you are asked to share these data with others, you need to get permission from the PI first.
2. If you plan to present our current research in any meetings, conferences, gatherings, symposia, classes, and reports either in person or in print, you need to contact me first before making any commitment. Please give me at least **1 week** to consider.
3. If you present only published work, you can use any of the published figures and tables. If you want to present unpublished data, you need to discuss this with the PI because some of the data may not be ready or the data is time sensitive. We may also need to get permission from other collaborators involved.
4. What you present should be the research project that you are directly participating in, which means you have done physical work and obtained data to generate figures or tables in the presentation. Do not assume that you can present your lab colleagues' work.

# Guidelines for Attending Research Conferences

## Why do we need these rules:

1. To encourage and reward scientific discovery and productivity.
2. To protect our research effort and discoveries
3. To avoid unfairness in the laboratory
4. To use our funding wisely

## Rules for Going to Conferences:

1. You need to talk to me at least **1 week** before the of the abstract submission deadline about your intention.
2. If you plan to go to a conference, you need to have most of the data obtained by the deadline of abstract submission.
3. The final decision depends on our current funding status. You are encouraged to apply for travel awards.

## Rules For Conference Attendees:

1. Before you go to a conference, you need to be familiar with current progress in the field of your presentation, background literature of your study, and hypothesis/goals of your presentation.
2. You need to finish the first draft of your poster at **least 2 weeks** before the conference and send it to me for editing.
3. You need to plan your conference itinerary ahead of time in order to learn and to network.
4. You will give us a presentation on what you have learned from the conference when you come back.
